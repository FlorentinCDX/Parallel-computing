# Parallel-computing

In this project, I implemented MLE of the logistic regression by Newton's Method. Further, CV and stepwise selection are implemented. Finally, the goal was to optimize it by vectorization and parallelization of the code.

Report.pdf is a report of the project, which I suggest as entry point.
